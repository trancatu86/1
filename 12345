We have written a manual for Actran VI for transmission loss analysis, it is good for learning how to operate and setting edat file, but I think we should not use it to build up edat file from beginning because it is time-consuming.
In transmission loss analysis case, Excel tool we created is useful for creating edat file. 
We should use it to create edat file and import it to Actran VI for checking and confirming parameter.
